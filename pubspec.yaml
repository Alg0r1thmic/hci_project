# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
   - assets/fonts/
   - assets/images/
   - assets/CustomIcons/
   - lang/

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: ProductSans
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Product-Sans-Regular.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Product-Sans-Italic.ttf
          style: italic
        - asset: assets/fonts/Product-Sans-Bold.ttf
    - family: Poppins-Bold
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins-Bold.ttf

    - family: Poppins-Medium
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins-Medium.ttf   
    - family: MyFlutterApp
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/CustomIcons/MyFlutterApp.ttf 
    - family: CustomIcons
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/CustomIcons.ttf
    - family: Health
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/health.ttf
    - family: Lungs
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/lungs.ttf
    - family: Medal
      fonts:
          - asset: assets/fonts/medal.ttf
